ugnos: Concurrent Time-Series Database Core in Rust

This crate provides a high-performance, concurrent time-series database core for Rust applications. It is designed for efficient ingestion, storage, and querying of large volumes of time-stamped data, with support for:
- Concurrent write buffering and background flushing
- Columnar in-memory storage
- Write-Ahead Log (WAL) and snapshot-based persistence
- Tag-based filtering and time range queries
- Thread-safe architecture

See the README for usage examples and more details.
